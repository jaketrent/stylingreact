      The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great
      shape. The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or
      knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten
      lost. Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust
      Lando. Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend.
